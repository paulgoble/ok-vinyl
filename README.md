## Base repository

Note: this is the base code for my Medium article: 'An Overview of React State Management Libraries'. The project includes a mock database for the purposes of populating the invemtory. It is not intended to be a complete application, but a base layer for the purpose of testing different implementations of managing state.

To run the application type `npm start`.
