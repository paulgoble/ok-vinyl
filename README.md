## Base repository

Note: this is the base code for my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@epaulgoble/four-react-state-management-libraries-an-overview-db3d00a0029a) 'Four React State Management Libraries: An Overview'. The project includes a mock database for the purpose of populating the inventory. It is not intended to be a complete application, but a base layer for use in testing various implementations for managing application state.

To run the application type `npm start`.
